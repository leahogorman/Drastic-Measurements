## **Description**
For this project we needed to create a React based app. It needed to use a database, allow for login and authentication, and use new technologies.
We decided to base our app around using GraphQL and Material UI, both new technologies. 

## **Elements**

This app includes 
* login page and a registration page that use Firebase as an authentication service.
* a home page that allows you to move to the search page and add page. The frontend/UI was done using Material UI
* An add page that allows you to add a new element to the database, based in GraphQL
* A search page that allows you to search for elements of the database, based in GraphQL
* An update page that allows you to update elements of the database, based in GraphQL

The connection is set up here for local use. Below in the commented out section is the JAWSDB connection.
